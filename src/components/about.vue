			<p>We All Gonna Make It.</p>
			<p>It's a revolution, in history of art, even history of humankind. Millions of people will be creating one artwork all together. Beeple, the famous digital artist, created the most expensive NFT artwork by creating an art piece each day for 5000 days, then it only takes 5000 people to create such an artwork in <strong>ONE</strong> day.</p>
			<p>The crowdsourced artwork is much more fasinating than a single artist's work. A single artist's time is limited, while the population in this world is likely limitless. No artist can live for 100,000 days, let alone creating.  But in the age of Metaverse, it isn't impossible for 100,000 people to create an artwork together.</p>
			<p>We call it <u>Artiverse</u>.</p>
			<p>At first, you'll need a tool to create the Artiverse, and we call the initial tool <u>MetaPen</u>. We'll need other tools to create the Artiverse, MetaPen holders are free to claim those tools.</p>
			<p>The first crowdsourced artwork, will be a painting on <u>MetaCanvas</u>. MetaCanvas is a canvas with 10,000 pixels, each holder of MetaPen will be able to draw a pixel on the MetaCanvas and get some utility token for one time, or overwrite other people's drawing by compensating the previous drawer with the utility token.</p>
			<p>By using MetaPen and later tools, people will create epoch-making artwork.</p>
			<p>The artwork will  be auctioned on platforms like OpenSea.  The proceeds from the auction of the NFT of the artwork will go directly to all the creators.</p>
			<p>Centralised agencies and galleries have been monopolying the art market for a long time, which will be gone with the help of blockchain and NFT. For the first time, it's the people creating the art. It will definitely be recorded in the history of blockchain, art and humankind.</p>
			<p>We expect you to join this revolution, by picking up your first MetaPen.</p>
			<p><strong>Remember: We All Gonna Make Art, <u>WAGMA forever</u>!</strong></p>
